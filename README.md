## My personal profile

- 🔭 I’m currently working on `study` 😉😉
- 🌱 I’m currently learning `linux kernel`, ` LFS `, `some basic systems` 🧀 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with **how to get started and learn the Linux system in depth, because I only know how to use it at this stage (a Linux administrator is a novice) ** 😕
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Japanese anime fan, welcome to discuss Japanese comics with me
- 💠:  I built my own blog, this is my web: [ICEのBlog](https://myblog.050626.xyz). 
- 🌀: At the same time, I used alist to build my own 🏠 storage server (and built a distributed storage cluster)
